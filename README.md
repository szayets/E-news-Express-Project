### E-news-Express-Project
This project evaluates news website new landing page using A/B testing, analyzing conversion rates, time spent, and language preferences.

This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

### Problem Statement
E-news portals like E-news Express leverage electronic platforms to quickly deliver news worldwide. 
E-news Express plans to increase subscriptions by analyzing user behavior on their website and improving webpage design to increase conversion rates.

### Objectives

The company's design team developed a new landing page with updated structure and more relevant content compared to the old one. To evaluate its effectiveness, I will study the sample of 100 randomly selected users split into two equal groups. One group viewed the existing landing page while the other viewed the new landing page, and data on user interactions was collected for analysis. The significance level was determined at 5%.

I need to answer the following questions:
* Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?
* Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
* Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
* Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?


### Conclusion and Business Recommendations

#### Based on our analysis of the dataset and testing various hypotheses, I found the following:

1. Users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the old one.
2. The new landing page converts more users than the old one.
3. Preferred language does not significantly impact the time users spend on the landing page.
4. Preferred language does not significantly affect the user conversion rate.
5. Converted users spent more time on the page compared to non-converted users.

#### Recommendations:

* Transition to the new landing page.  Since users spend more time on the new landing page and it converts more users than the old one, transitioning all users to the new landing page would likely improve engagement and increase subscriptions.
* Since the new landing page effectively improved user interest, consider further developing and enhancing it to increase user engagement and subscriptions even further.
* Continue to monitor user behavior and feedback to adapt strategies. Keep monitoring to make sure it aligns with what users like and with new technology.
